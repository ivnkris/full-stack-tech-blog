# Full Stack Tech Blog

## Description

In this project I have created a full-stack MVC application for a blog engine where users can create an account, log in and post and edit articles and comments.

## What I have done

- [x] Created data models using Sequelize
- [x] Created controllers to render and manipulate data
- [x] Created API and view routes including route protection for unauthorized users
- [x] Used handlebars.js as the templating engine of the application
- [x] Used jQuery for client-side interactions
- [x] Used Bootstrap for design
